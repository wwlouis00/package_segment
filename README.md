# Package Segmentation (Box and Object Detection Module)

## Functional Requirements
- **Conveyor Speed:** Support detection of boxes moving at a speed of 100 cm/s on a conveyor belt.  
- **Object Localization:** Provide feedback on the relative coordinates of detected objects within the captured image.  
- **Parallel Box Tracking:** Detect and track multiple boxes moving simultaneously in parallel, with the ability to report the relative coordinates of each box.  
- **Multi-Camera Support:** Enable multi-angle detection by integrating multiple cameras for improved coverage and accuracy.  

## Problem-Specific Challenges
- **Box Congestion:** Detect and handle scenarios where boxes may become congested or overlap on the conveyor belt.  
- **Multiple Objects in a Box:** Identify and report scenarios where a single box contains multiple objects, ensuring accurate object segmentation.  
- **Red Light Interference:** Maintain robust detection capabilities for boxes passing through red-light barriers or similar lighting interference.

## Detection Approach Using YOLOv8
- Implement YOLOv8 for real-time detection and segmentation of boxes and objects.  
- Utilize the segmentation model variant (e.g., YOLOv8n-seg or YOLOv8x-seg) for pixel-level accuracy in object boundaries.

### Model Training Details
- **Pre-trained Weights:** Models are fine-tuned starting with YOLOv8’s pre-trained weights, tailored for segmentation tasks (`YOLOv8n-seg.pt` for lighter models and `YOLOv8x-seg.pt` for higher accuracy and complexity).  
- **Epochs and Batch Size:** Optimized for 50 epochs to balance training time and model performance.  
- **Augmentation and Validation:** Incorporate Roboflow’s augmentation strategies to enhance model generalizability and validate performance on held-out datasets.

### Deployment Considerations
- Ensure the model is capable of real-time inference to meet the speed requirements of 100 cm/s.  
- Utilize multiple GPUs or distributed training techniques for scaling across multiple cameras or large-scale operations.  
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for the specific conveyor system and lighting conditions to maximize accuracy and robustness.
